# Goal and data used

The goal of this work is to develop an algorithm capable detecting the location of pedestrians as a way to obtain the performed trajectories and other important data to help analyse the situation and the effectiveness of our algorithm. All this with focus on using handcrafted features.

For this, it is used the Dataset S2: People Tracking, available on this website https://cs.binghamton.edu/~mrldata/pets2009
Specifically, it is used the dataset S2.L1 (View001). This means that isolated pedestrians are considered with little interactions between them.

# How to use
Each python file is responsible for solving a certain challenge

Will finish this in the future, too busy now
